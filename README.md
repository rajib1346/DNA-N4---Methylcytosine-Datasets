DNA N4-methylcytosine (4mC) as one kind of epigenetic modification of DNA has a critical role which alters genetic performance such as protein interactions, conformation, stability in DNA as well as the regulation of gene expression same cell developmental and genomic imprinting.  It simply plays a crucial role in restriction-modification system. Here I uploaded eight publicly available benchmark datasets named Caenorhabditis elegans (C.elegans),  Drosophila melanogaster (D.melanogaster), Arabidopsis thaliana (A.thaliana), Escherichia coli (E.coli), Geoalkalibacter subterraneus (G.subterraneus),  Geobacter pickeringii (G.pickeringi), Fragaria vesca (F. vesca), and Rosa chinensis (R. chinensis).
